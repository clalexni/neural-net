# Neural Net
- Linear Classification with Sigmoid Regression

## Goal:

## Requirements:

## Notes:
### Description:
- fake attribute is explicitly provided in dataset
- take arguments: training_file test_file learning_rate iteration

### Update RUle:
- Gradient Descent with logistic regression:
w_i = w_i + alpha * (y_k - sigmoid(wx^T)) * x_i * sigmoid'(wx^T)
